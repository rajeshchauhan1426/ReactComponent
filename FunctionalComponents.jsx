// In React, functional components are a type of component that is primarily defined as JavaScript functions. They are also known as "stateless" or "dumb" components because they don't have their own internal state and don't manage lifecycle methods. Instead, they receive data through props (short for properties) and return JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the UI.

// Here are the key components of a functional component in React:

// 1. **Function Declaration:** Functional components are defined as JavaScript functions. They take in `props` as an argument and return JSX elements.

//    ```javascript
//    function MyFunctionalComponent(props) {
//      return <div>{props.text}</div>;
//    }
//    ```

// 2. **Props:** Props are inputs to a React component. They allow data to be passed from parent to child components. In functional components, you access props directly as function arguments.

//    ```javascript
//    function MyFunctionalComponent(props) {
//      return <div>{props.text}</div>;
//    }
//    ```

// 3. **JSX:** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript. Functional components return JSX to describe the component's UI.

//    ```javascript
//    function MyFunctionalComponent(props) {
//      return <div>{props.text}</div>;
//    }
//    ```

// 4. **Rendering:** Functional components are responsible for rendering UI elements based on the data passed via props. They return the JSX code that defines the component's appearance.

//    ```javascript
//    function MyFunctionalComponent(props) {
//      return <div>{props.text}</div>;
//    }
//    ```

// Functional components are typically used for presentational components that are focused on rendering UI based on input data. They are a key part of React's component-based architecture and are often used in conjunction with other React features like hooks for managing state and side effects. With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can also manage state and lifecycle behaviors, making them even more powerful and versatile.
