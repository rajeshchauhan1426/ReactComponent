// In React, functional components are a way to create and manage the user interface of a web application. Functional components are also known as "stateless" or "dumb" components because they are primarily responsible for rendering UI based on the input props they receive. They don't have their own internal state or lifecycle methods like class components.

// Here's how you can define a functional component in React:

// ```jsx
// import React from 'react';

// function MyFunctionalComponent(props) {
//   // You can use props to access data passed from parent components

//   return (
//     <div>
//       <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
//       <p>{props.description}</p>
//     </div>
//   );
// }

// export default MyFunctionalComponent;
// ```

// In this example, `MyFunctionalComponent` is a simple functional component that takes `name` and `description` as props and renders them in the JSX. Functional components are primarily focused on rendering UI elements based on the props they receive.

// With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can also manage local component state and side effects using hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and others. This allows functional components to handle more complex logic and behavior while still being more concise and easier to read than class components.

// Here's an example of a functional component using React Hooks:

// ```jsx
// import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// function MyFunctionalComponent() {
//   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);cfgjv

//   useEffect(() => {
//     document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
//   }, [count]);

//   return (
//     <div>
//       <p>Count: {count}</p>
//       <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
//     </div>
//   );
// }

// export default MyFunctionalComponent;
// ```

// In this example, `useState` is used to manage the `count` state, and `useEffect` is used to update the document title whenever the `count` state changes. This demonstrates how functional components can handle both rendering and state management.
=======
// In React, functional components are a type of component that is primarily defined as JavaScript functions. They are also known as "stateless" or "dumb" components because they don't have their own internal state and don't manage lifecycle methods. Instead, they receive data through props (short for properties) and return JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the UI.

// Here are the key components of a functional component in React:

// 1. **Function Declaration:** Functional components are defined as JavaScript functions. They take in `props` as an argument and return JSX elements.

//    ```javascript
//    function MyFunctionalComponent(props) {
//      return <div>{props.text}</div>;
//    }
//    ```

// 2. **Props:** Props are inputs to a React component. They allow data to be passed from parent to child components. In functional components, you access props directly as function arguments.

//    ```javascript
//    function MyFunctionalComponent(props) {
//      return <div>{props.text}</div>;
//    }
//    ```

// 3. **JSX:** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript. Functional components return JSX to describe the component's UI.

//    ```javascript
//    function MyFunctionalComponent(props) {
//      return <div>{props.text}</div>;
//    }
//    ```

// 4. **Rendering:** Functional components are responsible for rendering UI elements based on the data passed via props. They return the JSX code that defines the component's appearance.

//    ```javascript
//    function MyFunctionalComponent(props) {
//      return <div>{props.text}</div>;
//    }
//    ```

// Functional components are typically used for presentational components that are focused on rendering UI based on input data. They are a key part of React's component-based architecture and are often used in conjunction with other React features like hooks for managing state and side effects. With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can also manage state and lifecycle behaviors, making them even more powerful and versatile.
