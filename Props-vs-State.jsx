// In React, both `props` and `state` are used to manage and pass data within a component, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

// **Props (short for properties):**

// 1. **Immutable**: Props are read-only data that are passed from a parent component to a child component. Once props are set, they cannot be modified by the child component. This immutability ensures that the parent component remains in control of the data it passes.

// 2. **Functional Components**: Props are commonly used in functional components to receive data and configuration from their parent components.

// 3. **External Data**: Props are often used to pass data from a higher-level component down to a lower-level component. For example, you might pass a user's name or configuration settings as props to a child component.

// 4. **Reactive Updates**: When the data passed as props changes in the parent component, React automatically re-renders the child component with the updated props.

// Here's an example of using props in a React component:

// ```jsx
// function Greeting(props) {
//   return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
// }
// ```

// **State:**

// 1. **Mutable**: State is used to manage internal component data that can change over time. Unlike props, state is mutable and can be modified within the component itself.

// 2. **Class Components**: State is typically used in class components, although with the introduction of React Hooks, it can also be used in functional components using the `useState` hook.

// 3. **Component-Specific Data**: State is used to store data that is specific to a particular component and may change as a result of user interactions or other triggers. For example, you might use state to manage the visibility of a modal dialog or to keep track of a counter.

// 4. **Reactive Updates**: When the state of a component changes, React will re-render that component to reflect the updated state.

// Here's an example of using state in a React class component:

// ```jsx
// class Counter extends React.Component {
//   constructor(props) {
//     super(props);
//     this.state = { count: 0 };
//   }

//   increment() {
//     this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
//   }

//   render() {
//     return (
//       <div>
//         <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
//         <button onClick={() => this.increment()}>Increment</button>
//       </div>
//     );
//   }
// }
// ```

// In summary, `props` are used to pass data from parent to child components and are immutable within the child component, while `state` is used to manage and update data within a component and is mutable. Understanding when to use `props` and when to use `state` is essential for building React applications effectively.
